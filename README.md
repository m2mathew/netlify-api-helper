# Netlify API Helper

This little app provides a way to use a limited subset of the Netlify API.

It's hosted on Netlify at â†’ `https://netlify-api-helper.netlify.com/`

It's like a hat on a hat...it's a Netlify API built on top of the Netlify API hosted on Netlify.

## To Use

1. Clone this repo
2. Make an .env file with your [Netlify API Token](https://app.netlify.com/user/applications).
    - Only used if you are running locally. When the app is deployed, you will authorize with Netlify's API in a super-safe way. ðŸ˜Ž
3. Run `yarn && yarn start`
4. Open up [your browser](http://localhost:3000)
5. Click the "Log in with Netlify" button to see information about your user/account/sites.
